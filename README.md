# API-project
The current project analyzes financial stock data of a company, using the requests package.

Here are the particular tasks associated with the API project:
- Collect data for the ticker Nvidia.(keep in mind that the date format is YYYY-MM-DD).
- Convert the returned JSON object into a Python dictionary.
- Calculate what the highest and lowest opening prices were for the stock in this period.
- What was the largest change in any one day (based on High and Low price)?
- What was the largest change between any two days (based on Closing Price)?
- What was the average daily trading volume during this year?
- What was the median trading volume during this year. (Note: you may need to implement your own function for calculating the median.)
